# Laser-game
During my third year at INSA Toulouse, we had to design a laser game. 
We made an electronic circuit which converts laser into an electrical voltage signal transmitted to an ARM Cortex-M STM32 microcontroller. Afterwards, we worked on a C program to init the communication beetween a computer and theARM Cortex-M STM32 microcontroller, it is the file principal.c. This file also tranforms the electrical voltage signal which is a continuous signal into a discrete signal thanks to timers. When the communication was established and the transformation done, we developed a assembly program (file Tempo.s) which allowed to distinguish between six laser guns which one shot a specific target thanks to the Discrete Fourier Transform. Finally we could convert the electrical voltage signal received by ARM Cortex-M STM32 into points appearing on a seven-segment display for each one of the six players.
